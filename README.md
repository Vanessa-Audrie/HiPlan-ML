# HiPlan - Machine Learning Documentation

HiPlan-ML is a repository specifically use to store machine learning models used in [HiPlan](https://github.com/HarHamz/HiPlan) to assist hikers with:
- Weather forecasting based on historical time-series data.
- Difficulty and time prediction based on mountain features and weather.
- Recommender system to suggest mountains based on user preferences.
- A Streamlit app for simple model inference and interaction.

This repository contains multiple models and experiments, each stored in separate folders with their own documentation. 

For the full project, check [HiPlan](https://github.com/HarHamz/HiPlan) repository.

## Data ETL
This folder contains scripts for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. Raw hiking-related datasets are cleaned, transformed, and structured to support various models in the project. This includes operations such as handling missing values and preparing data for training and inference.

## Monthly Weather Prediction
The Monthly Weather Prediction module is designed to forecast critical weather parameters that influence hiking safety and experience, including precipitation probability, temperature, humidity, and wind. This module uses a feed-forward Deep Neural Network model due to its ability to capture complex patterns between input features, such as the position of a day within the annual cycle and long-term year-to-year trends. The model successfully predicts monthly weather tendencies, with an average performance evaluation of **R¬≤ = 0.56**.

## Difficulty and Time Prediction
The Difficulty and Time Prediction module estimates both the difficulty level and the expected duration of a hike using key features such as mountain height, trail distance, elevation gain, and real-time or forecasted weather conditions (precipitation probability, wind speed, temperature, and humidity). It employs a multi-output feed-forward Neural Network model, chosen for its ability to predict two outputs simultaneously while leveraging inter-output relationships for improved accuracy. The model achieves high performance with **R¬≤ = 1.00 for both difficulty and time prediction**, and low error rates of **MAPE = 0.31% for difficulty** and **0.20% for time estimation**, helping users assess whether a trail suits their physical ability and schedule.

## Recommender System
The **Recommender System** utilizes a **content-based filtering** approach to suggest mountains that align with the user's preferences. By analyzing user input such as location and mountain elevation, the system compares this data to existing mountain profiles and recommends similar options. This method is especially suitable for **cold-start scenarios**, where there is no prior user history, making it effective for first-time users or those exploring unfamiliar hiking areas. The system delivers personalized recommendations with high accuracy, achieving **Precision\@5 = 1.00**, meaning all top-5 recommendations are relevant to the user's input.


## Simple Streamlit Inference
The Simple Streamlit Inference module provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with all the models. Through this application, users can input relevant parameters and instantly receive predictions on weather, difficulty, time estimation, and hiking recommendations. This integration ensures that the entire system is accessible and usable by non-technical users in a seamless and interactive manner.
