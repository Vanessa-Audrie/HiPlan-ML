# HiPlan - Machine Learning Documentation

HiPlan-ML is a repository specifically use to store machine learning models used in [HiPlan](https://github.com/HarHamz/HiPlan) to assist hikers with:
- Weather forecasting based on historical time-series data.
- Difficulty and time prediction based on mountain features and weather.
- Recommender system to suggest mountains based on user preferences.
- A Streamlit app for simple model inference and interaction.

This repository contains multiple models and experiments, each stored in separate folders with their own documentation. 

For the full project, check [HiPlan](https://github.com/HarHamz/HiPlan) repository.
